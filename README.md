Sakila Database - SQL Query Practice

Overview
This project uses the Sakila sample database, which simulates a movie rental store. The database includes tables like film, actor, customer, rental, and category. The goal is to practice SQL queries using this database in MySQL Workbench.

Objectives
* Learn basic SQL queries (SELECT, FROM, WHERE).
* Use aggregation functions (GROUP BY, HAVING).
* Practice joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, UNION).
* Work with subqueries and correlated subqueries.

How to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench.
2. Load the SQL file: File > Open SQL Script.
3. Execute queries and review the results.

Exercises
The project includes 25 exercises covering topics like:
1. Retrieving unique movie titles.
2. Filtering movies by rating or duration.
3. Joining tables to find actor and rental details.
4. Using subqueries to filter specific results.
5. Aggregating data (e.g., rentals per category or average movie length).

Notes
Each query is commented for clarity, explaining the logic and SQL methods used.
